# developerworks-scraper

I made a post asking for how I could access all posts I've ever made on the forum. Since no one replied, I made this
thing to do it for me, sort of.

## Requirements

 - Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

 - Open a terminal and `cd` to where you put these files
 - Run this command `npm install`

## Running

 - Open a terminal and `cd` to where you put these files
 - Run this command `npm start` (or one of the other folders)

## Output

You can find the results in the `/outputs` folder.
